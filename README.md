# InsertSortCounter


Created an insertion sort algorithm with a counter in the while loop. 
The for loop will be run n amount of times regardless of the input. 
This will count, based on different inputs, how many times the while loop is accessed. 

Tells us that 50% 1's followed by 50% 0s gives the most accesses into the while loop.
